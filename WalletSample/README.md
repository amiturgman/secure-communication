## Installation instructions

The following instructions will help you get started with a working SaaS wallet deployed on Azure.

### Prerequisites
1. An Azure subscription id
2. Setup an Azure Active Directory application
3. Prepare the [Service principal id and secret and assign it to a contributor role](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-create-service-principal-portal)
4. An Azure Active Directory TenantId - Same link as step 3
5. Prepare the Azure Service principal object id
   1. Go to the azure portal
   2. Go to Azure Active Directory -> Enterprise Applications -> All applications. 
   3. Filter for your recently created application. One of the columns is 'Object Id'. 
   4. Copy this value for later use.
6. Install [Azure Powershell SDK](https://www.microsoft.com/web/handlers/webpi.ashx/getinstaller/WindowsAzurePowershellGet.3f.3f.3fnew.appids)
7. Install [Service Fabric SDK for Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/service-fabric/service-fabric-get-started)

### Deploy resources
1. Edit the parameters in the file [WalletSample/Deployment/oneclick.ps1](WalletSample/Deployment/oneclick.ps1)
2. Open the Powershell console **(As administrator)** and navigate to the file's location.
3. run .\oneclick.ps1
   1. The script will create a resource group and deploy different resources into it. Some of the resources are Azure Service Fabric cluster, storage accounts, KeyVaults, Azure SQL, etc...


The script will take a few minutes to finish.
Once done:
1) Go to certificates folder (*c:\saaswalletcertificates* if left the certificate folder location as is), a pfx file will be present.
Install it under 'Local User' (the password was specified in the script earlier)
2) Open up the solution in Visual Studio **(As administrator)**
3) Update [cloud.xml](WalletSF/publishprofiles/cloud.xml) with the Service Fabric cluster name, cluster location and the certificate thumbprint (needed for deploying the application to the cluster) - the detalis can be found in the powershell script output.
4) Update [appsettings.json](WalletSample/WalletApp/appsettings.json) and [App.config](WalletSample/TransactionEngine/App.config) file with the 'EthereumNodeUrl' value
* The 'EthereumNodeUrl' paramater should be generated by creating a new public/test account:
https://infura.io/docs/gettingStarted/chooseaNetwork
5) Open Visual Studio, Load the solution, Right click on the 'WalletService', click publish, choose the newly created Service Fabric cluster
6) Once done, navigate to **http://**\<SFClusterName\>.\<location\>.cloudapp.azure.com/
